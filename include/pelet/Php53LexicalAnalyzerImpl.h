/**
 * The lexer has different rules based on where in the source code a specific token is.
 * The various states are:
 * 
 * INLINE_HTML: in this state the lexer will skip over all tokens and stop (right before) 
 * the open tag
 * SCRIPT: in this state all of the php keywords and symbols are honored. For example "if" is 
 * an T_IF token and not an identifer.
 * PROPERTY: in this state keywords are NOT honored; any alphanumeric string will labeled as an
 * identifier.  For example; in php an object is allowed to have a property called "list"
 * BACKTICK: in this state the lexer will not honor any keywords or symbols.
 * Note that this is different than the PHP lexer; the PHP lexer handles embedded variables
 * but that functionality is not needed by the editor.
